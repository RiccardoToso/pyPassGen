# pyPassGen
Random password generator written in python

pyPassGen is a very simple but effective password generator. You can specify the length of the password and the quantity of both numbers and symbols. The program will randomly choose the amount of lowercase and uppercase letters to fill the remaining chars.

In version 1 you have to provide the inputs from interactive prompts (The suggestions are displayed in Italian) and there is not default values.

In version 1.5 you can provide the inputs via the command line. Type pyPassGen-v1.5.py -h to get the help output.

The default parameters are length=15, num=5 and sym=5.

This is a trivial experiment used to apply the basics of python into a real word application. I don't expect the passwords generated to be completely random.
